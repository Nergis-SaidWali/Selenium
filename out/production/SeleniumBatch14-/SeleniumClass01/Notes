Difference between driver.quit() and driver.close()
--> close() -it will close the current tab only
--> quit() -it will quit the whole browser


Difference between driver.get() and driver.navigate.to()
--> get() -it will open a url
--> navigate.to() - it opens the url, it has additional functionalities like:
driver.navigate.back();
driver.navigate.forward();
driver.navigate.refresh();

!!navigate() keeps the history of the browser.
!!driver.get() is going to wait for the page to fully load before proceeding further whereas driver.navigate()
will not wait for the page to fully load
